# Schema Zen - Script and create SQL Server objects quickly

## Schema Zen has three main commands:

### script

    dotnet schemazen script --server localhost --database db --scriptDir c:\somedir

This will generate sql scripts for all objects in the database in a
directory structure that looks something like:
```
c:\somedir\
	data
	foreign_keys
	procedures
	tables
	views
	props.sql
	schemas.sql
```

### create

    dotnet schemazen create --server localhost --database db --scriptDir c:\somedir

This will create a database named db from the sql scripts in c:\somedir.


### compare

	dotnet schemazen compare --source "server=dev;database=db" --target "server=qa;database=db" --outFile diff.sql

This will compare the databases named `db` between `dev` and `qa` and
create a sql script called `diff.sql` that can be run on `qa` to make it's
schema identical to `dev`.


See ```dotnet schemazen help [command]``` for more information and options on each command.
